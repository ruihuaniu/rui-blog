### Shock by AI
I have used AI for a while, starting from the GitHub copilot (GPT-3), and I'm using it frequently for my daily like and work. It kind of make me away from using Google to search for information. It's really freezing at the beginning and brought me a lot of surprise with its evolving. But today, it shocked me with its power of creating a whole application. 

### How AI will affect software development
It will definitely change the way we develop software. It will make the software development more efficient and more productive. It will also change the way we think about software development.

At the first beginning, I noticed that AI can help with reducing the redundant work like writing the utility functions, or the boilerplate code like unit test case. But today, I found that AI can help with creating the whole application from scratch. It's really shocking. 

AI today shows its power of creating a totally new application with creative UX design. 80% of this 3D [Solar system visualization](https://solar.niuruihua.com) was created by AI within a few hours which is unbelievable in the past.


#### Current issues of using AI for software development
Even though AI has a great power and is increasing its capability at a rapid pace, there are still some issues that need to be solved.

##### The cost of using AI is still high. 
All current AI tools that are able to create an application are not free. And the cost is high if the application is crafted with continuous AI assistance.

It shouldn't be a big issue for the long term, as the cost of AI will be reduced as the technology evolves. But for the next issue, I'm not sure if it can be solved in the near future.

##### The quality of the application created by AI is not guaranteed.
Even the AI is able to create an application with a good UX design, the code quality is still a big issue. The code created by AI is not well-structured and not with a good architecture design. It's sometimes hard to understand the code created by AI with lots of junk codes, and then it's hard to modify and maintain the code.

Can this issue be fixed in near future? I'm not sure considering the complexity of the software development, especially for the large-scale applications.

Is the bad code really an issue? Probably not. The "bad code" is a subjective opinion from the human perspective, but if the AI can create the whole application by itself, it can also maintain the code by itself. So if it doesn't need human intervention, the bad code might be a good code from the AI perspective.

### How AI will affect our daily life
AI is already affecting our daily life in many ways. It likes a smart assistant that can help us with many things. It can help us with our work, our study, our entertainment, and even our daily life.

What about the future?
